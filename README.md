Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! I built this site using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, two of my favorite tools for building modern, responsive web applications.

This site serves as a showcase of my work as a front-end developer. You'll find a range of projects here, from simple static websites to more complex web applications.

I chose to use Next.js for this project because of its powerful features for building server-rendered React applications. It also comes with some great optimizations out of the box, such as automatic code splitting and prefetching, which help to improve the performance and speed of the site.

And of course, I couldn't have built this site without Tailwind CSS. I used it to quickly and easily style the various components and elements on the site, which allowed me to focus more on the functionality and content of the site.

I'm really proud of how this site turned out, and I hope you enjoy browsing through my work. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out!
